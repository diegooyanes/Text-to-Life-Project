    <h1>Welcome to the path of humility</h1>
    <p>You have chosen the path of Lazarus in “The Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus” in the Gospel of Luke, reflecting “The Great Reversal.” Because of the choices you have made you will find kindness and compassion in heaven. This is a place of peace and fulfillment.</p>
